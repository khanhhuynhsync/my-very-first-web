                    <h2>Solar System Overview</h2>
                    <p>The solar system has one star, eight planets, five officially recognized dwarf planets, at least 290
                        moons,
                        more than 1.3 million asteroids, and about 3,900
                        comets.</p>
                    <p>It is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur. Our
                        solar
                        system orbits the center of the galaxy at about
                        515,000 mph (828,000 kph). It takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the
                        galactic
                        center.</p>
                    <p>We call it the solar system because it is made up of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by
                        gravity
                        – the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
                        Jupiter,
                        Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris – along with
                        hundreds of
                        moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and
                        meteoroids.</p>
                    <p>Our solar system is the only one we know of that has a planet that supports life. So far, we only
                        know of
                        life on Earth, but we’re looking for life on other
                        worlds.</p>
